A modern &ndash; and somewhat opinionated &ndash; [_Middleman_](https://middlemanapp.com) template, with an external pipeline handled by [_Gulp_](https://gulpjs.com). :v:

## The name

In [The Elder Scrolls universe](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net), one of its most prominent [in-game creation myths](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad) recounts the tale of _[Anu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu)_, and how they in a convoluted fashion became a parent of the habitable world of _Creation_, before ultimately banishing themselves and their antagonistic sibling to the spaces beyond _Time_.

So yes, it's a name taken from one of the _creators_ in a creation myth, which I think is appropriate for a web development template. :relaxed:

## How to get started

_Anu_ is built on top _Middleman_ and _Gulp_, which in turn means it is built on top of _Ruby_ and _Node(.js)_, two popular programming languages and enviroments, so first we need to check if they exist on our system, by running these commands in a _command line interface_.

```banishing
# Check if any Ruby version exists
ruby -v

# Check if any Node version exists
node -v
```

If they are both installed â€“ as in, not giving you a sad error message â€“ then you can safely hop along to [the installation section](#installation). If you did get an error message, you should check out [the prerequisites](#prerequisites) for using _Middleman_ and _Anu_. :blush:

### Prerequisites

Because both [_Ruby_](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [_Node_](https://nodejs.org/en/) are fairly large programming environments, it might be a good idea to consider using a package manager for them, as well as for many other development libraries and helpers. Regardless of your operating system of choice, I would like to recommend [_Homebrew_](https://brew.sh), which is available for _macOS_ as-is, and for _Linux_ and _Windows_ with [_Linuxbrew_](https://docs.brew.sh/Linuxbrew).

Following the guides on _Homebrew's_ website for either version should lead to it being installed on your system â€“ yay! :beer:

#### Ruby

To install and use _Ruby_ well, we'll need to install two little utilies via _Homebrew_: [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [`ruby-build`](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build). `rbenv` is a version manager for _Ruby_, which is handy if you need to work within multiple _Ruby_ environments that require different contexts; `ruby-build` is the actual worker of the two and lets us actually download, compile, and then install _Ruby_.

To install these two utilities â€“ and later _Ruby_ itself â€“ we can happily follow [`rbenv's` awesome guide](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation).

##### Ruby version?

_Anu_ is currently set up to work with version `2.4.3` of _Ruby_, which isn't the newest one, but the latest one that is pre-installed on [_Netlify_](https://www.netlify.com), where I like to host many of my _Middleman_ projects. If you need or want another version, that's totally possible, just remember to edit the contents of the [`.ruby-version` file](template/.ruby-version) to maintain order in your project.

#### Node

Just like with _Ruby_, it's a good idea to use a version manager to handle projects and their contexts differently; _Node's_ manager is called [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), and will let us manage all different versions with ease. [`nvm's` guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) is a bit more technical, but shouldn't be a problem for you. :blush:

##### Node version?

Unlike with _Ruby_, _Anu_ does not have any &ldquo;strong&rdquo; opinions on what version of _Node_ you use, but I can personally recommend using the latest and most stable version, which should be the default option with _nvm_.

### Installation

With both _Ruby_ and _Node_ installed, we can finally move on to _Middleman_ and _Anu_. First, we need to install _Middleman_:

```bash
gem install middleman
```

Yes, that's it. With _Middleman_ installed, we can now use _Anu_ as a template:

```bash
# Creates a new Middleman project with
# this template in the folder 'my-project'
middleman init 'my-project' -T oscarpalmer/anu
```

Awesome, now we can make cool websites! :sunglasses:

### Basic usage

Alright, with everything installed, it should be as easy as riding a bike, right? Well, almostâ€¦ :wink:

There's a [README](template/README.md) included with the tempalte which is full of tips and tricks for getting the most out of _Anu_.

Have fun, and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://twitter.com/ohpalmer) if you run into problems. ðŸ¤“

## What's included?

The gems and packages listed below are only _Anu_'s direct dependencies, but almost all of them depend on others to make development better and more fun, so thanks to everyone involved! :blush:
