# Anu

A Middleman template.

## The name

In [The Elder Scrolls universe](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net), [one of its most prominent in-game creation myths](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad) recounts the tale of <i>[Anu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu)</i>, and how they in a convoluted fashion became a parent of the habitable world of <i>Creation</i>, before ultimately banishing themselves and their antagonistic sibling to the spaces beyond <i>Time</i>.

So yes, it's a name taken from one of the _creators_ in a creation myth, which I think is appropriate for a web development template. :relaxed:
