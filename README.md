# Anu

A modern &ndash; and somewhat opinionated &ndash; [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) template, with an external pipeline handled by [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com). :v:

## Getting started

For now, there's only this:

```bash
# create a new middleman project with
# this template in the folder 'my-folder'

middleman init my-folder -T oscarpalmer/anu
```

Step-by-step instructions are incoming, I promise.

## Included libraries, gems, packages, etc.

The gems and packages listed below are only Anu's direct dependencies, but almost all of them depend on others to make development better and more fun, so thanks to everyone involved! :blush:

## The name

In [The Elder Scrolls universe](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net), [one of its most prominent in-game creation myths](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad) recounts the tale of <i>[Anu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu)</i>, and how they in a convoluted fashion became a parent of the habitable world of <i>Creation</i>, before ultimately banishing themselves and their antagonistic sibling to the spaces beyond <i>Time</i>.

So yes, it's a name taken from one of the _creators_ in a creation myth, which I think is appropriate for a web development template. :relaxed:
